This project is going to be a mini log analyzer. I plan on using this for learning purposes specifically to improve on the basics of Python using Linux Ubuntu(WSL), this will include topics such as variables, loops/range, integers, if/else, functions, lists, and dictionary. After this project I should have a much better understanding of Python's syntax,  making multiple task work together using one .py file, and also how to create a menu providing simple navigation for the user. 12-11-25
