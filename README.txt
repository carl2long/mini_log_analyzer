This project is going to be a mini log analyzer, I plan on using this for learning purposes specifically to improve on the basics of Python using Linux Ubuntu(WSL). This will include a variety of topics such as variables, loops/range, integers, if/else, functions, lists, and dictionary. After this project I should have an all around much better understanding of how Python works: making multiple task work together using one .py file and also how to create a menu providing simple navigation for the user. 12-11-25
